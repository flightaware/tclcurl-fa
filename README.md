# TclCurl - get a URL with FTP, TELNET, LDAP, DICT, FILE, HTTP or HTTPS syntax.

## Introduction

TclCurl gives the Tcl programmer access to the facilities of libcurl, for more information
about what libcurl is capable of check http://curl.haxx.se.

To make type:

      ./configure ?--enable-threads?
      make
      make install

The configure script will deduce `$PREFIX` from the tcl installation.
The generated `Makefile` uses the file `$PREFIX/lib/tclConfig.sh` that was left by
the make of tcl for most of its configuration parameters.

There is another file, ReadMeW32.txt, to explain how to compile in Windows.

## Troubleshooting

If you are running Red Hat or Fedora and you are compiling from source,
make sure the directory `/usr/local/lib` is listed in `/etc/ld.so.conf`,
if it isn't add it before installing cURL.

If the configure script doesn't detect Tcl even though it is there, it
is probably because there is no `tclConfig.sh` file, maybe you need
to install a `tcl-devel` package or maybe it would be a good idea
to download the latest version, and install that.

## Usage

    package require TclCurl

    set curlHandle [curl::init]

    curlHandle perform

    curlHandle getinfo curlinfo_option

    curlHandle duphandle

    curlhandle cleanup

    curl::transfer

    curl::version

    curl::escape url

    curl::unescape url

    curl::curlConfig option
